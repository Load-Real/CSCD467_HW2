Description: Unzip the submitted LDemersCSCD467HW2.zip, you get a folder of the same name. Inside the folder are ReadMe.txt, MyPrimeTest.java, ThreadPrime.java, SerialPrime.java, and Counter.java.

To Compile: cd into folder LDemersCSCD467HW2,
javac *.java

To Run:
java MyPrimeTest nthreads low high

***NOTE: While running this code in Eclipse, the parallel code's cost was faster than the serial's for all examples provided. HOWEVER, when I attempted to compile and run the same code in command line, the example (java MyPrimeTest 4 1 100000) has a tendency for the parallel code to be slower, BUT only this one example. I tried to figure this out for hours to no avail.
